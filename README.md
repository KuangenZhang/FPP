This is the implementation of Foot Placement Prediction for Assistive Walking by Fusing Sequential 3D Gaze and Environmental Context in Python.

### Test
1. Download the data from the dataset link: [data.zip](https://alumniubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/kuangen_zhang_alumni_ubc_ca/EVEUrVJqvfJEuzZYpTTsF-cBH-G8dxGUoFdiyzEMw_Ni8g?e=Gqsu7U)
2. Uncompress the data.zip to FPP/data folder.
3. Run code:
```
python main.py
```
